# Happy Thoughts

For this project, I built a twitter-like site where you can post Happy Thoughts. 
It's connected to a simple API.

## What I learnt

-What a component lifecycle means
-How to use the UseEffect hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes.
-How to call APIs from React and put the data into state
-To fetch and post data from an API
