# Happy Thoughts

For this project, I built a twitter-like site where you can post happy thoughts. </br>
It's connected to a simple API.

## What I learnt

-What component lifecycle means </br>
-How to use the UseEffect hook in React to perform actions when components mount, unmount, or when state changes </br>
-How to call APIs from React and put the data into state </br>
-To fetch and post data from an API
